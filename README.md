# write-words-diagonally
This takes an input and then writes the word diagonally, also contains a function that can turn it back
For example the string: "Hello everyone, I hope you find this code useful"
would turn into:


H l   r , p f s e       
e o e e o   i s         
l v n h u h u           
e o   o t               
y I y   e               
    d d                 
e n o                   
i c l                   
  u                     
f 

At the bottom of the code there are options that can change the output, like the width and height of the message. You can also copy the final message to your clipboard
